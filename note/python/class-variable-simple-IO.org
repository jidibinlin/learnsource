* using quotation and character string
** we can use quotation to generate a character string.we can use "" or '',just simply like this.
*** double quotation 
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
	print("this is a character string")
    #+END_SRC
*** quotation 
	#+BEGIN_SRC python 
	print('this is a character string')
	#+END_SRC

** we can use "" in ''or use ''in "" to print "" or ''
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
	#use "" in ''
	print('this is a "string"')
	#use '' in ""
	print("this is a 'string'")
    #+END_SRC

** print multiple values by using " , " between character string then they will be splited by space character
*** we can write like this
    #+BEGIN_SRC python 
    print("first ","second ","third")
    #+END_SRC

*** or like this
	#+BEGIN_SRC python
	print("first",
	"second",
	"third") 	
	#+END_SRC

*** even
	#+BEGIN_SRC python
	print("first second third")
	#+END_SRC


* specify the end character
** we can use end="end character" to specify the end character
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   print("Here", end="\n")
   print("it is...")
   
   #+END_SRC

* create triple-quoted string
** we we use it we can print the string the same as what we write in the code
  #+BEGIN_SRC python 
  print("""
  /\
  ||
  """)
  
  #+END_SRC

* link strings and repeat strings
** we can use " + " to link strings
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   print("we can concatenate two "+"strings with the \"+\" operator.")
   
   #+END_SRC
** use the"\"to split a long string
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   print ("This string "+"may not "+"seem terr "+"ibly impressive. "\
   +"but what "+" you don`t know")
   #+END_SRC
** we can repeat a string like this
   #+BEGIN_SRC python 
   print("o"*10)
    
   #+END_SRC

* variable
** create a variable
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   name = "name"
   
   #+END_SRC
** using a variable
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   print(name)
   print("hi,",name)
   
   #+END_SRC
** naming principle
*** variable name only can contain number,alphabet,and underline
*** variable can`t start with number

* get input
